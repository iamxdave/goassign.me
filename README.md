<!-- HOW DOES IT WORK-->
## How does it work üìî
<p>
  The application allows logged users to make notes and update existing ones to track their implementation progress.</br>
  It also always current users to make accounts for new ones to share them board filled with notes.</br>
  All passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** package and all data is restricted only for logged users.</br>
